# SPACECATS!
_Explore the universe of optimal cattednes._

## Your mission

You are an intrepid engineer, founding fresh feline frontiers in new galaxies,
such that they may be populated, as ours is, with adorable kittens. Of course,
the attributes of any one galaxy strongly affect the ability for a cat to
survive there.  Luckily for you, modern data transfer and cloning techniques
allow you to spawn a particular cat in a particular galaxy and get a report back
of how wll it fared.

Using these amazing technologies, you are to report back on the optimal cat you
can produce in each galaxy. Delivery your report to jobs+spacecats@causes.com,
including the cats you discovered, the code you wrote, and a description of your
process.

Happy cat catching!

## API

The API currently lives at http://spacecats.heroku.com

### List galaxies
`GET /galaxies` responds with a comma-separated list of known galaxies

#### Example
    GET /galaxies
    => milky_way,andromeda

---

### Fitness
`GET /galaxies/<galaxy>` is a fitness function that expects three parameters:

*  **weight**: The weight of your Spacecat, between 1 and 1000 kg
*  **limbs**: The number of limbs your Spacecat has, between 0 and 100
*  **color**: A hex RGB string indicating the color of your Spacecat
*  **batch**: _(optional)_ `true` if you're submitting a batch of attributes

It responds with an integer indicating how well your Spacecat survived the
galaxy. Obviously, higher values are better.

#### Batching
By including `batch=true` in your request, you can submit batches of Spacecat
attributes to be evaluated all at once. The response becomes a
comma-separated list of all fitnesses.

#### Examples
* A standard black cat:

        GET /galaxies/milky_way?weight=3&limbs=4&color=333333
        => 1

* A fictitious, yellow megacat:

        GET /galaxies/milky_way?weight=300&limbs=60&color=FFFF00
        => 0

* Both in a batch:

        GET /galaxies/milky_way?batch=true&weight=3,300&limbs=4,60&color=333333,FFFF00
        => 1,0
